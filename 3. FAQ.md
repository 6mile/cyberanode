    <summary>What if I have multiple products and services?</summary>

    There are some companies that are going to have a large number of diverse products and services. For these companies we suggest splitting up the listings, for example if you run a Managed detection and Response business and also IR consulting, then its probably best to create two listings to ensure enough details can be provided to the users.

    If you unsure, just ask us and we'll let you know what we advise.

<summary>How can I get my Company listed?</summary>

To register, companies must meet the following criteria:
1. Be Australian owned.
2. Deliver cyber security products or services, category definitions can be found [here](2.%20categories.md).
3. Hold a valid Australian Business Number (ABN), operate in Australia, and employ staff in an Australian location.

If you meet this criteria you can submit an [issue](issues) following the `Company registration request` issue template. We will then create the listing page for you in the pending-company-listing and look for your approval to finalise and move to company-listing via the issue. If we have further questions we will reach out there.
